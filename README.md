# FastOcean_New
An easier-to-use version of the FastOcean Blender add-on, in that you can now call its operators from command line.

Example:

The fastocean operator's ID is "create.fastocean". Therefore, you can call it by running the command line:

> bpy.ops.create.fastocean()

Same logic for all other operators.
